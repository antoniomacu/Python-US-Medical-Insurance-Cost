# Python-US-Medical-Insurance-Cost
- The purpose of this project is to analyze the population from the 'insurance.csv' file, in order to inspect how different
  factors such as number of children, smoking, BMI percentage... can impact the insurance's costs.

  For that an exploratory analysis using functions, diccionaries, loops and python algebra is been implemented during the course
  of the project, sorting the data for clearness and efectiveness.

  Lastly the data is been analyzed, resulting in conclusions about the data, possible trends regarding health factors and costs, and 
  possible bias in the data collected.

  As I was working in the project, I realized on ways to optimize the functions I was working with and the code in general, that's why
  a development is noticeable in the further sections of code in the project.
  Any advice is appreciated!
